I run one of the debian mirrors, and I had to write this patch because
my archive is split between more than one disk. Would you accept a more
polished version of this patch for inclusion in rsync?

To use this patch, run these commands for a successful build:

    patch -p1 <patches/soften-links.diff
    ./configure                           (optional if already run)
    make

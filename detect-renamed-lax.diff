This patch adds the options --detect-renamed-lax and --detect-moved.
These modify the --detect-renamed algorithm to adopt a matching file
without verifying that the content is as expected.  The former blindly
accepts a file that matches in size and modified time.  The latter
requires that the filename also match (ignoring any renamed files).

This patch is EXPERIMENTAL, though it did work correctly in my light
testing.

To use this patch, run these commands for a successful build:

    patch -p1 <patches/detect-renamed.diff
    patch -p1 <patches/detect-renamed-lax.diff
    ./configure                                 (optional if already run)
    make

FIXME: If a run with --detect-renamed-lax stages a different-basename
destination file and then gets interrupted, a subsequent run that
switches to --detect-moved blindly accepts the staged file.

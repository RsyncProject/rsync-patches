This patch adds a --slow-down=USECs option that causes the sender to scan
the filelist more slowly, and the generator to scan for deletions more
slowly.  It doesn't do anything to make anyone slow down during the normal
transfer processing, though.

The idea is to lessen rsync's impact on disk I/O.  Unfortunately, there
should really be a way to affect more of rsync's processing, perhaps by
specifying a maximum disk I/O rate (and have that affect a maximum stat()
rate or something like that).

To use this patch, run these commands for a successful build:

    patch -p1 <patches/slow-down.diff
    ./configure                           (optional if already run)
    make

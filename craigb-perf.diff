I've been studying the read and write buffering in rsync and it turns
out most I/O is done just a couple of bytes at a time.  This means there
are lots of system calls, and also most network traffic comprises lots
of small packets.  The behavior is most extreme when sending/receiving
file deltas of identical files.

The main case where I/O is buffered is writes from the server (when
io multiplexing is on). These are usually buffered in 4092 byte
chunks with a 4 byte header. However, reading of these packets is
usually unbuffered, and writes from the client are generally not
buffered.  For example: when receiving 1st phase checksums (6 bytes
per block), 2 reads are done: one of 4 bytes and one of 2 bytes,
meaning there are 4 system calls (select/read/select/read) per 6
bytes of checksum data).

One cost of this is some performance, but a significant issue is that
unbuffered writes generate very short (and very many) ethernet packets,
which means the overhead is quite large on slow network connections.

The initial file_list writing is typically buffered, but reading it on
the client is not.

There are some other unneeded system calls:

  - One example is that show_progress() calls gettimeofday() even
    if do_progress is not set.  show_progress() is called on every
    block, so there is an extra system call per (700 byte) block.
    (NOTE: this was already fixed in 2.6.0, so it is no longer in
    this patch.)

  - Another example is that file_write writes each matching (700 byte)
    block without buffering, so that's another system call per block.

To study this behavior I used rsync-2.5.6cvs and had a benchmark area
comprising around 7800 files of total size 530MB.

Here are some results doing sends and receives via rsyncd, all on the
same machine, with identical source and destination files.  In each
case --ignore-times (-I) is set, so that every file is processed:

  - Send test:
  
        strace -f rsync -Ir . localhost::test |& wc

    shows there are about 2,488,775 system calls.

  - Receive test:

        strace -f rsync -Ir localhost::test . |& wc

    shows there are about 1,615,931 system calls.

  - Rsyncd has a roughly similar numbers of system calls.

  - Send test from another machine (cygwin/WinXP laptop):

        tcpdump port 873 |& wc

    shows there are about 701,111 ethernet packets (many of them only
    have a 4 byte payload).

Since the source and dest files are the same, the send test only
wrote 1,738,797 bytes and read 2,139,848 bytes.

These results are similar to rsync 2.5.5.

Below is a patch to a few files that adds read and write buffering in
the places where the I/O was unbuffered, adds buffering to write_file()
and removes the unneeded gettimeofday() system call in show_progress().

The results with the patch are:

  - Send test: 46,835 system calls, versus 2,488,775.
  
  - Receive test: 138,367 system calls, versus 1,615,931.

  - Send test from another machine: 5,255 ethernet packets, versus 701,111.
    If the tcp/ip/udp/802.3 per-packet overhead is around 60 bytes, that
    means the base case transfers an extra 42MB of data, even though the
    useful data is only around 2MB.

The absolute running time on the local rsyncd test isn't much different,
probably because the test is really disk io limited and system calls on
an unloaded linux system are pretty fast.

However, on a network test doing a send from cygwin/WinXP to rsyncd
on rh-linux the running time improves from about 700 seconds to 215
seconds (with a cpu load of around 17% versus 58%, if you believe
cygwin's cpu stats).  This is probably an extreme case since the system
call penalty in cygwin is high.  But I would suspect a significant
improvement is possible with a slow network connection, since a lot
less data is being sent.

Note also that without -I rsync is already very fast, since it skips
(most) files based on attributes.

With or without this patch the test suite passes except for
daemon-gzip-upload.  One risk of buffering is the potential for
a bug caused by a missing io_flush: deadlock is possible, so try
the patch at your own risk...
